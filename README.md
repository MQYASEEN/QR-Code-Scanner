# QRCode Scanner

## Overview
This Python script is a simple QR code scanner that uses the OpenCV library to capture video from your computer's camera and detect QR codes. If a valid URL is found within the QR code, it will open the URL in a web browser. Otherwise, it will display the QR code's content in the console.

### Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure you have the following:

Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website.

The required Python packages installed, including cv2 (OpenCV) and webbrowser. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless  # or 'opencv-python' if you need the full OpenCV package
```
```bash
pip install webbrowser
```
A computer with a working camera connected.

### Usage
Clone or download the script to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python qrscanner.py
```
The script will start capturing video from your camera and display it. Hold a QR code in front of the camera.

If the QR code contains a valid URL (e.g., 'http://' or 'https://'), the script will open that URL in your default web browser.

If the QR code does not contain a URL, its content will be displayed in the console.

To exit the script, press 'q' while the OpenCV window is active.

### Known Issues
If you encounter issues related to missing libraries, ensure you have the necessary dependencies, such as 'numpy,' installed.

Please note that this script may not work with certain types of QR codes or in low-light conditions.
